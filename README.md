ZipChord allows you to seamlessly **combine regular typing with chording and shorthands**. Chords let you type whole words by pressing a combination of keys simultaneously. That's what stenographers do and what makes them so fast.

You don't need to learn stenotyping though. Languages obey Zipf's law, so it takes only a few dozen chords to accelerate a huge amount of all your typing. For example, just 32 unique words make up 40% of the whole text of _The Lord of the Rings_. So even a small number of chords with simple key combinations can make your typing faster and more comfortable.

I could not find any software that supported keyboard shortcuts of more than two keys and regular typing at the same time, so I built ZipChord to make this type of typing possible.

## Features

- Chord recognition (also known as chorded entry or chording)
- Shorthands that expands typed abbreviations to full words
- Customizable user dictionaries for chords and shorthands
- Real-time hints about available shortcuts in on-screen display or tooltips
- Automated capitalization and smart spaces around shortcuts and punctuation
- Configurable keyboard and language settings
